    Color Guessing Game.
    A summary:
    - Include a list of colors in an array
    - In function do_game():
        - Randomly select one of those colors in the array as the target
        - Optionally: display the target (to help with debugging and marking) e.g. alert(target);
        - Go into a loop which
            - Shows the array of colors and asks the player for their guess
            - Using the function check_guess():
            - Displays a message such as ‘I don’t recognize that color!’ If the text entered by the player is not in the array of colors, OR:
            - Displays a message such as ‘Your input is alphabetically higher than mine!’ if that is true, OR:
            - Displays a message such as ‘Your input is alphabetically lower than mine!’ if that is true, OR:
            - If the player’s input is the same as the target: changes the web page background color to the target color and displays a message which includes the total number of guesses such as ‘You are right! You took 8 guesses!’
            - Stops if the player’s input is the same as the target
